# 📖 CDQL Master Reference (A-Z)

Welcome to the **cluaizd Query Language (CDQL)** syntax dictionary.
This is a comprehensive, alphabetical reference of all CDQL keywords, operators, and functions used for querying the database engine.

| Keyword | Description |
|---|---|
| [`cosine_distance`](./cdql/cosine_distance.md) | Executes hardware-accelerated angular distance calculations for normalized vector embeddings, utilized primarily in NLP and semantic search workflows.<hr>`find similar using cosine_distance` |
| [`crispr`](./cdql/crispr.md) | Bypasses automated execution affordances to manually inject or sever direct 64-bit memory pointers (Graph Edges) between isolated records.<hr>`POST /crispr/force/uuid` |
| [`delete`](./cdql/delete.md) | Injects a tombstone marker into the B-Tree index, ensuring immediate exclusion from subsequent traversals while deferring physical memory compaction.<hr>`delete where id == '...'` |
| [`euclidean_distance`](./cdql/euclidean_distance.md) | Computes strict L2-Norm spatial point distances. Internal Min-Heap sorts evaluate squared distances to optimize CPU caching behavior.<hr>`find similar using euclidean_distance` |
| [`find`](./cdql/find.md) | Initiates a zero-copy LMDB read iteration. Bypasses IPC overhead to stream raw byte arrays directly from the OS page cache to the TCP buffer.<hr>`find *` |
| [`force`](./cdql/force.md) | Atomically writes a weighted directional memory pointer into a record's adjacency array, writing exclusively to the WAL for crash durability.<hr>`force/uuid-1 target_id='uuid-2'` |
| [`gt`](./cdql/gt.md) | Evaluates strict boundary constraints. Utilizes zero-allocation byte casting to evaluate values before heap instantiation occurs.<hr>`where age > 18` |
| [`insert`](./cdql/insert.md) | Streams raw binary or JSON payloads directly to the Write-Ahead Log (WAL), mapping immediately into the primary MVCC B-Tree.<hr>`POST /neuron` |
| [`limit`](./cdql/limit.md) | Halts memory traversal iterators upon threshold completion, preventing backpressure on the network socket during massive sequential scans.<hr>`find * limit 10` |
| [`lt`](./cdql/lt.md) | Evaluates reverse-boundary constraints. For indexed fields, it invokes reverse B-Tree traversal and backward iterators to optimize sort ordering.<hr>`where age < 18` |
| [`similar`](./cdql/similar.md) | Re-routes the query planner to the AI Vector subsystem, leveraging CPU SIMD instructions to perform parallel high-dimensional proximity scans.<hr>`find similar using cosine_distance` |
| [`update`](./cdql/update.md) | Performs MVCC-compliant, lock-free memory mutations. Allocates a new payload block and atomically swaps the B-Tree pointer to prevent read blocking.<hr>`update json where id == '...'` |
| [`where`](./cdql/where.md) | Applies byte-level evaluation logic. If unindexed, rejects records prior to JSON deserialization; if indexed, targets precise B-Tree nodes.<hr>`find json where status == 'active'` |

> Because cluaizd uses an **Absolute Flexible Architecture**, we do not hardcode hundreds of static mathematical keywords into the CDQL parser. If you need to perform complex aggregations, map-reduce, or custom math, you simply inject a **WASM Execution Affordance** (Script) into the record's `dna` field. The engine executes your custom logic directly inside the database memory space at zero-copy speeds.
